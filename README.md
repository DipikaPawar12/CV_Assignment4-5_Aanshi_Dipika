## Introduction
---    
The human eye is capable of recognising, localising the features and classifying the images according to the variations present in the image at a very fast pace. In the man-made machines or systems, the capability of classifying the images according to the variations present is very less. The use of CNN in these systems help in increasing the classification accuracy as it creates a feature map for the features present within an image and predicts the label of the image using the minute-detailed as well as general features.
